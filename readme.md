# Canister

Canister is a Rust project that provides basic file system interaction functionalities. It allows users to perform simple CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on files in the filesystem.

## Features
- **Create File**: Users can create a new file by providing a directory path, file name, and content.
- **Read File Content**: Users can read the content of an existing file by specifying its path.
- **Update File**: Users can update the content of an existing file.
- **Delete File**: Users can delete a file from the filesystem by providing its path.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the Canister repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the application using the Rust compiler:



## Usage
1. Upon running the application, you will be presented with a menu prompting you to choose an action.
2. Enter the corresponding number to perform the desired operation.
3. Follow the prompts to input necessary information (e.g., directory path, file name, content).
4. Based on your input, the application will execute the chosen operation and provide feedback on the outcome.

## Future Enhancements
- **File Search** (Future Enhancement): Implement a search functionality to search for files based on their names or content within a specified directory.
- **File Compression** (Future Enhancement): Integrate functionality to compress files into common archive formats (e.g., ZIP, TAR) and decompress them when needed.
- **File Metadata** (Future Enhancement): Provide access to file metadata, including details such as creation date, last modified date, file size, and file type.
- **File Sharing** (Future Enhancement): Integrate file sharing functionality that allows users to share files securely with others via email, messaging apps, or cloud storage platforms.

## Technologies Used
